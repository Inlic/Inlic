# Full-Stack Software Developer

# Profile

I am a software developer with a background in data analytics.  I previously worked for Vacasa where I optimized revenue streams by utilizing SQL and Python scripting.  I am passionate about utilizing software to create applications and solve problems. I have fully developed 2 Full-stack web applications and have contributed to 2 more as part of an agile development group. 

I enjoy quickly learning new skills and programming languages, backend and frontend frameworks,  design patterns like Model View Controller (MVC), and other methods of organizing code.  So far I have experience with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C#, Python, Bootstrap, Git/Github, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and R.  I am enthusiastically looking into other programming languages, design frameworks, and principles that I can integrate into my existing knowledge in order to solve problems and build better software applications.
